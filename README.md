Frontend Coding Challenge Hopkins
=================
This challenge is about building a small interface that shows the weather for the next 3 days. As a user I would want to be able to use it to get the following information.

### Demo

https://mk-weather-forecast.herokuapp.com/

### Requirements
1. In the morning I want to check the weather for today to make sure that I can dress accordingly.
2. Sometimes, when I leave home for the weekend, I want to make sure that it's not too windy, as I have sensitive plants on my balcony that I would have to put into my flat otherwise.
3. I also want to be able to set whether I need rain or not. My plants should stay hydrated.
4. I am usually checking the wheather on my phone, so it should be responsive

### Goal
Come up with a nice interface that addresses the user's needs. 

### Rules
- Use React as the sorrounding framework
- You are allowed to import other libraries for the interface such as MaterialUI, AntDesign, styled-components ...
- Please do not spend more than 1 to 2 hours for this challenge
- Do all the editing within this glitch. This helps us to understand the steps you took better
